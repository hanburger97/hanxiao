                            I was afraid of heights and one day
                            when I was 15, I decided I wanted to conquer my fear and fly. By age 17 I obtained both my glider and private pilot
                            licenses. To say that it happened without a hitch and without tears, sweat and anxiety would be a lie.
                            One thing I learned from becoming a pilot is that, there are no such things as "free lunches" in life. Everything requires
                            sacrifice and effort, and, of course, a bit of luck.

                            When I was an edgy teenager at 18, I co-founded a non-for-profit organization that raises awareness for a heart disease affecting children.
                            Through that roller-coaster experience, I learned that making an impact is easier said than done. And I learned that lesson
                            through hard work, paperworks, heated discussions and compromises.

                            As I moved on to the next chapter of my life, I now aspire to become a software engineer, I believe that my love for problem solving
                            and grit will help me make a positive impact in technology.
                            I currently study at the University of Waterloo in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ in software engineering with a minor in computational mathematics.
