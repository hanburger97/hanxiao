                        At the age of 17, I conquered my fear of heights by becoming a licensed glider and private pilot.
                        Slowly, I have learned to conquer my fear of failure and overcome my anxiety. Flying through the sky has emboldened me to conquer 
                        any challenge with a growth mindset.

                        I now aspire to become a software engineer and currently study at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong>  ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

                        During my internship at <strong>Shopify</strong>, I have worked on core back-end development in Ruby on Rails and Go. I have also worked on
                        prototyping a new proxy SQL server for sharded databases. The latter really gave me an overview of distributed systems and databases and made me fall
                        in love with the topics. 
                        <br/>
                        At <strong>North</strong>, formerly known as Thalmic Labs, I have worked on building a new role-based OAuth cloud authentication systems for smart glasses.
                        I have also worked at <strong>Intact Insurance</strong> as a data engineer in the machine learning lab and at <strong>Nuance</strong> as a testing intern.
