                        <p>
                        At the age of 17, I conquered my fear of heights by obtaining both my glider and private pilot licenses. 
                        By becoming a pilot, and by overcoming endless nights of anxiety, tears and sweat, I learned that the fear of failure 
                        was my greatest opponent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        When I was 18, I co-founded a non-for-profit organization that raises awareness for a heart disease affecting children.
                        It turned out to be a failed venture, however, through long nights of heated discussions and compromises,
                        I learned the value of making an impact and the hard work that goes with it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Emboldened by my fearlessness to fail, I now aspire to become a software engineer and currently study at the 
                        University of Waterloo ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. 
                        I hope that my relentlessness to bow to failures will make me grow and become a better engineer.
                        <br />
